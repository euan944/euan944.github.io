            The White and Navy Clad AT01 at the historic 2020 Italian Grand Prix<span class="a"></span>
            <img class="CarPic" src="../images/img/Monza2020.png" alt="Monza" /><span class="a"></span><br> An incredible 2020 Italian Grand Prix saw AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly claim a maiden Formula 1 win from the McLaren of Carlos Sainz
            and the Racing Point of Lance Stroll,<span class="a"></span> as a transgression under the Safety Car saw polesitter Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton forced to serve a 10-second stop/go penalty, leaving him seventh at the flag.<span class="a"></span>            That left Gasly at the head of the field, after he’d pitted before the Safety Car was brought out,<span class="a"></span> with the Frenchman holding on brilliantly to take a sensational maiden win in Formula 1 at AlphaTauri’s home race,
            <span class="a"></span> as McLaren’s Carlos Sainz finished second, with Racing Point’s Lance Stroll completing the podium.

            <img class="CarPic" src="../images/img/Brazil2019.png" alt="Interlagos" /><span class="a"></span> But with two laps to go when the race restarted, Hamilton tagged Albon, leaving the Thai driver to finish P14,<span class="a"></span>            while Gasly was able to hold off Hamilton in a drag race to the line to claim his own first podium in F1 – with the stewards later handing Hamilton a five-second penalty for his part in the Albon incident,<span class="a"></span> which ultimately
            dropped him to P7. Behind, a great day for Carlos Sainz saw him make it from P20 at the start to P4,<span class="a"></span> before later getting promoted to his first top-three finish after Hamilton's penalty.<span class="a"></span> He finished
            ahead of the Alfa Romeo pair of Kimi Raikkonen and Antonio Giovinazzi, with Renault’s Daniel Ricciardo sixth, Hamilton seventh, McLaren’s Lando Norris eighth,<span class="a"></span> while Racing Point’s Sergio Perez and the second Toro Rosso
            of Daniil Kvyat rounded out the top 10.
