<!--Hello!, So if you are reading this you might be wondering what this page is for, don't blame you my teammates don't get it either and I have gotten tired of trying to explain it.
So, github pages needs the homepage to be named Index.html and it needs the homepage to be stored in the root, this broke our lovely and neat program a little so my soluation was 
simple have a dummy homepage that once you left you could never return to. 
Fortunatley we found another solution to this problem and this page is obsolete, a relic of an earlier part of development. I felt it was fun to keep and wasn't harming anything.

If you are just looking about this code for fun, Hello. And if you are lurking through the website to update things, good luck and have fun with it. I certainly did.
